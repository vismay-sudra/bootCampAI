SOLID Design Principles

1. The Single Responsibility Principle: Two different processes should not be part of the same function.

2. Open/Closed Principle: New features should be achieved throug addition to an existing program rather than modification of previous functions of the program.

3.Liskov Substitution Principle: If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering
                                  any of the desirable properties of that program.
                                 
5. Dependency Inversion Principle: Abstractions should not depend on details.
